# Setup

The first question to answer is which programming language to choose?
I had 2 choices - Rust or C++. So, after doing a bit of research, I found out that Rust has problems with Linked Lists. Hence, I am selecting C++ as my language of choice for learning DSA.

By default, c++ compilers are already installed on Linux machine. So, I can simply compile any c++ file and execute those.

## Executing a c++ file

```bash
g++ file.cpp -o temp && ./temp
```

This will compile the c++ file into a temp executable which is then executed.

# Learning Process

Started with Linked Lists
