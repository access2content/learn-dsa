# Introduction

Linked List is a Linear Data Structure.
Data is not stored in contiguous memory locations.

Each element of a LL is known as a Node.

# Structure of a Node

1. Data of the Node
2. Address/Reference of Next Node

# Questions

1. Given an integer array of size N, create a linked list and return the Head.

# Concepts

## Head

The reference to the memory location of the first node is known as Head of the Linked list.

# Notes

We only track where the first node is present in the memory.

Each node will provide the location of the next node.

The last node of the Linked List will point to null since there are no more elements.

For C++, using struct is faster as compared to class due to implementation logic.
